<b>EasyJCE</b>
provides an easy to use interface for encrypting and decrypting data for
transmission or storage using the Java Cryptographic Extension (JCE).
EasyJCE supports most algorithms implemented for the JCE, including
those provided by third-party encryption service providers. Integrated
MAC (Message Authentication Code) support can optionally be used to
ensure data integrity and indicate possible data tampering. A set of
Hibernate user types is also included to transparently integrate
encryption into the data layer, ensuring data is persisted in its
encrypted form while obscuring encryption and decryption logic from
application code. EasyJCE also provides basic encoding and decoding
facilities for transmitting encrypted binary data through mediums which
are limited to printable ASCII characters, such as email messages or
URL's.
